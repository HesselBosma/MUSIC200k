# MUSIC-200k

MUSIC-200k is a data set create for the purpose of training the cancatenated audio visual transformer, described in my master thesis: Audio-visual Correlation from Cross-modal Attention in Self-supervised Transformers on Videos of Musical Performances. MUSIC-200k is a set of video id's that have been human labeled for various categories (see vocabulary file). MUSIC-200k is a subset of the Youtube8M dataset https://research.google.com/youtube8m/. MUSIC-200k stores the real Youtube video id's of all samples containing the "musician' label, and has been cleaned further to for example remove video clips and game montages.

n_train = 172811

n_test = 19196

The actual size of the usable data of course depends on the availability of these videos on Youtube.

Feel free to use this dataset anyway you like
